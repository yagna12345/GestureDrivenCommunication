Gesture Driven Communication is an innovative computer vision project that interprets human hand gestures and converts them into meaningful commands, text, or speech. The system enables touchless communication between humans and machines — empowering accessibility, automation, and interaction using hand gestures.
The Gesture Driven Communication project bridges the gap between humans and computers by enabling intuitive communication through gestures.
It uses real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition powered by deep learning and computer vision.

This system can be used by individuals with speech or hearing impairments or in hands-free environments like robotics, virtual control systems, or IoT applications.
